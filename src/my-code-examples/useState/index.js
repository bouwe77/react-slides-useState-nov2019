import React from "react";

export default () => <>Let's create a stateful function component :)</>;

// What we'll learn in this example:
// * React does not know state has changed unless you tell it explicitely.
// * How to use the useState hook to do make a component stateful.
// * How to update state using a user event.
// * That re-rendering takes place after the event handler function has finished.
